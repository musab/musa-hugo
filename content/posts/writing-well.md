Writing clearly and effectively is crucial for communication, especially for software engineers. Here is Jeff Bezos' concise guide to improve your writing skills:

## 1. Use Short Sentences
- **Keep sentences under 30 words.**
- Simplify phrases:
  - **Instead of:** Due to the fact that
  - **Use:** Because
  - **Instead of:** Totally lacked the ability to
  - **Use:** Could not

## 2. Replace Adjectives with Data
- Be precise and use measurable data:
  - **Instead of:** We made the performance much faster.
  - **Use:** We reduced server-side p90 latency from 10ms to 1ms.

## 3. Eliminate Weasel Words
- Avoid vague language:
  - **Instead of:** Nearly all customers
  - **Use:** 87% of Prime members
  - **Instead of:** Significantly better
  - **Use:** +25 basis points (bps)

## 4. Pass the "So What?" Test
- If the reader might ask "So what?" about a statement, revise it to be more impactful and specific.

## 5. Provide Clear Answers
- When asked a question, respond with one of these four clear answers:
  1. Yes.
  2. No.
  3. A number.
  4. I don't know (and will follow up when I do).

## 6. Be Objective: Avoid Adjectives and Adverbs
- **Adjectives are imprecise and non-decisive.**
  - **Subjective:** Sales increased significantly.
  - **Objective:** Unit sales increased by 40% in Q4 2011 compared to Q4 2010 due to holiday promotions.
  - **Subjective:** We made the application much faster.
  - **Objective:** We reduced server-side training 90-day latency from 10ms to 1ms.

## 7. Avoid Jargon and Acronyms
- **Exclude non-experts and newcomers:**
  - Always explain technical terms, acronyms, and abbreviations the first time they appear.
  - **Example:** After we sign the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)...

## 8. Avoid Weasel Words
- **Donâ€™t use vague phrases like:**
  - "Would help the solution"
  - "Might bring clarity"
  - "Should result in benefits"
  - "Significantly better"
  - "Arguably the best"
